REBUILD HERO HEADER SECTION – FULL INSTRUCTIONS FOR RIVLET AGENT AI
MANDATORY RESTRUCTURE:

Rebuild the entire Hero Header section from scratch — both HTML and CSS must be cleaned, modular, and non-redundant. Do not patch the existing code. Rebuild the layout and styling from the ground up using clean semantic HTML, custom class names, and minimal inline styles.

Why? We must avoid spaghetti code or quick patches that break on future updates. All components must be easily updatable and clearly separated for readability.

✅ IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES EXACTLY:
FONT + SIZING

Increase headline (h1) font size by 20–30%

Make it bold, left-aligned on desktop, center on mobile

Subheadline (p) should be 16–18px with ample line height

NEW TEXT (REMOVE NAME, MAKE IT TEAM-BASED)
Replace current subtext with:

"Get insider protection from our team of ex-auto finance professionals. We've helped hundreds of buyers avoid thousands in scams, hidden fees, and dealer traps."

GRAPHIC UPDATE

DELETE the Google Search Console screenshot

ADD a glowing, animated “Dealer-Proof Shield” badge centered or floating to the right of the text block

Use subtle CSS glow animation, like:

css
Copiar
Editar
@keyframes glowPulse {
  0% { box-shadow: 0 0 5px #00ffcc; }
  50% { box-shadow: 0 0 25px #00ffcc; }
  100% { box-shadow: 0 0 5px #00ffcc; }
}
Then apply it to the shield badge element.

URGENT MESSAGE (TRUST BUILDING)
Add this under the main heading:

"Every 8 minutes, a first-time buyer gets scammed. Don’t be next."

CTA BUTTONS (NO CHANGES)

Keep both:

"Get Protected Now – $49.99"

"Watch How It Works"

Ensure mobile responsiveness, button stack behavior, and hover animation is included

INFO BULLETS (WITH ICONS)
Replace current checkmarks with SVG icons for:
