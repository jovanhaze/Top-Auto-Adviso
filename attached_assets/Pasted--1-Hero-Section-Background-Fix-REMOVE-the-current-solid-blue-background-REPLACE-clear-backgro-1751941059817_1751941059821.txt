 1. Hero Section Background Fix
REMOVE the current solid blue background.

REPLACE  clear background so they can see the nice in the back 


📊 3. "Trusted by Car Buyers Nationwide" Section – REMOVE OR REPLACE
Remove any fake or inflated metrics:

❌ “2.4M protected”

❌ “98% success rate”

❌ “500+ buyers served”

Replace with more realistic trust builders or useful data like:

✅ “24-hour response guarantee”

✅ “100% transparent contract reviews”

✅ “Insider advice from ex-auto finance pros”

Keep icons, layout, and structure — just swap out the BS numbers.

🧾 4. Add Missing Sections
✅ Must Add:
Blog Section

Placeholder: “Coming Soon: Real scam stories, car buying hacks, and negotiation tips”

 ADD THIS SECTION at bottom of home page above footer – “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ)
Place it near the bottom of the homepage, right before or after the blog placeholder.

🧱 SECTION STRUCTURE:
Title: Frequently Asked Questions

Layout: Accordion style (expand/collapse)

Include the following 5 FAQs, styled with simple icons (like ❓ or car emoji) and bolded questions.

✅ FAQ Content:
1. ❓ What exactly do you do?
We review your contract or offer before you sign anything, explain every fee, and help you avoid getting scammed. It’s like having an ex-dealer on your side.

2. 📸 How do I send you my paperwork?
Just text us a photo or upload it through our secure form. We accept photos, PDFs, screenshots — whatever you’ve got.

3. 🕒 How fast do I get help?
Most buyers get a same-day Zoom review — sometimes within the hour. We also offer emergency calls if you're stuck at the dealership.

4. 🚨 Can you tell me if a car is a lemon?
Yes. We’ll flag red flags like accident history, shady wording, or sketchy warranties. We’re not mechanics — but we know scam signals from miles away.

5. 💸 Why is there a fee?
Because this advice can save you $2,000 to $10,000. $49.99 is cheaper than any mistake you could make without it.

🎨 DESIGN NOTES FOR RIVLET:
Use expandable accordion design

Add a small trust icon (checkmark, shield, or car emoji) next to each question

Ensure mobile readability: large tap targets, no overflow

➕ Optional Suggestions (add if space permits):
Who We Help section

Title: “Who We Work With”

Bullets: First-time buyers, busy professionals, single parents, military/veterans, etc.

Optional: Placeholder logos for affiliate agents, loan officers, etc.

Make it feel more human and protective — not corporate

📐 6. Overall Layout Tweaks

Recheck padding, margins, and text centering
